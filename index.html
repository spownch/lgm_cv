						<p><a style="font-style: italic;">London (UK) April ´16 – April ´18</a></p>
						<p>Working directly with the Senior Category Vice President of the second largest Unilever HPC Category in terms of turnover, I developed a strong strategic understanding of the roles that different brands and regions play in managing a Category as a whole. Particularly important to this role was my ability to build personal relationships with key stakeholders across all levels in the organisation as well as my pro-activeness.</p>
